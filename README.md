# Age-Claculator

In this project I used typescript instead of JavaScript for more security and performance of the application.
In this application I wrote code about calculating age.
If you don't write down any date of birth or don't complete it completely, you'll see the error "Please fill out all fields to get access age calculation!". This error disappears after 3 seconds of occurrence...
And if you write down some date that is still ahead, you receive the “Not Born Yet” alert.
I also checked if the year is viscose and made February 29 days.
And I put a calculator icon to make it visually pleasing.
This was my first project. I don't know how much you will like it, but I will try to complete more interesting projects for you!
